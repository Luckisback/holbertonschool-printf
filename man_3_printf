.SH Description: The Argument List

When printf processes its arguments, it starts 
printing the characters it finds in the first argument, 
one by one. When it finds a percent it knows it 
has a format specification. It goes to the next ar- 
gument and uses its value, printing it according to 
that format specification. It then returns to printing 
a character at a time (from the first argument). 
It is okay to include more than one format speci- 
fication in the printf string. In that case, the first 
format specification goes with the first additional ar- 
gument, second goes with second, and so forth. Here 
is an example:
int x = 5, y = 10;
printf ( "x is %d and y is %d\n", x, y );
